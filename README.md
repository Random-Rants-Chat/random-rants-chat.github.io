# Random Rants (GitHub Pages)

**Random Rants** was a browser-based chatting and social app, originally created to run on school Chromebooks.

## How It Started

Random Rants began during my time in middle school, while I was in one of my electives. I met someone who was using Scratch, and we started talking. I showed him a simple chatting site I had made called *Macre’s Chat*.

That person turned out to be [Im_CatmanYT](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Im_CatmanYT/), and he liked the idea. Soon after, I saw him and his friends using the site. The next time we met, he suggested I make an improved version — and I agreed.

He recommended a color scheme inspired by Google Docs, but I chose a neutral gray instead. He also provided some PNG-style emojis sourced from memes. That’s how **Random Rants v0.1** was born.

From there, we shared ideas through Google Docs, and during school I found myself regularly working on the project — often as a distraction. Over time, those small updates and ideas shaped what became the original Random Rants.

## Why It Shut Down

The original Random Rants was hosted on Glitch, which I used for most of my projects. When Glitch began shutting down project hosting, the site went offline.

Beyond that, I no longer had much motivation to maintain it. The codebase was outdated and had serious security flaws. I didn’t want to risk it being used in unsafe ways — especially since the app had a global room system that allowed anyone to follow users without privacy controls.

Some of the main issues included:

- No private or unlisted rooms  
- Anyone could join your room or track which room you were in  
- The auto room selector prioritized rooms with people, increasing the chance of being followed  

Because of these risks, it didn’t feel right to keep the original site online.

## What’s Next

The good news is that **Random Rants Plus** is still available, built on cleaner and more secure code.
